# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a woman programmer who loves to code and solve complex problems. But guess what? I also love Barbie! Yes, you heard it right. I believe in breaking stereotypes and I'm proud to be a Barbie-loving coder.

## My Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, ReactJS
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB
- **Others**: Git, Docker, AWS

## My Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Barbie's Dreamhouse**: A virtual reality game where you can design and decorate Barbie's Dreamhouse.
2. **Barbie Dress-up**: A web-based game where you can dress up Barbie in various outfits.
3. **Code with Barbie**: An interactive platform where kids can learn to code with the help of Barbie.

## Fun Fact
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing with my Barbie collection or watching Barbie movies. My favorite is "Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper".
